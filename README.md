I'm a **Senior .NET Developer** with 20+ years of experience building enterprise applications. I specialize in **.NET 9, C#, ASP.NET Core, WPF**, and architectural patterns like **MVVM**, **CQRS**, **DDD**, and **Event Sourcing**.

Previously, I was the **Founder & CTO** of a music-tech startup, where I led product and technology strategy for 4 years.
